          <h3>Context</h3>
          <p>
            This was made as a part of a case study where an app of your own
            choosing was to be improved. The case included information about the
            app, the issue it solves and background, it's target group, goals,
            usage problems and the design of improvements. Due to the short time
            span no user testing was made.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <ul>
          Hormona is an app for tracking hormone levels, with several features:
        </ul>
        <li>Daily logging of periods and symptoms (such as acne, headaches)</li>
        <li>
          Personalized insights and advice on lifestyle changes (including diet,
          exercise, and sleep)
        </li>
        <li>
          Hormone testing for home delivery, integrated with the app, providing
          a more accurate picture of hormone levels
        </li>
        <p>
          <b>Target group. </b>Women, 20-50 years old with an interest in
          health.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The menstrual cycle is a woman's fifth vital sign. </b>More and
          more women are experiencing issues related to hormonal imbalance. This
          can range from diagnoses like PCOS to milder symptoms. At the same
          time, the number of involuntarily childless individuals is rising,
          making menstrual cycle tracking an increasingly important part of
          pregnancy planning today. For those who do not wish to become
          pregnant, hormone-free contraceptives have become the new trend. This
          is why I chose to narrow the target group to women aged 20â€“50, even
          though the range of women in their fertile years is broader. The
          assumption is that issues with hormonal imbalance are often identified
          after the teenage years or later, and that family planning typically
          occurs later in life. I also believe the target group has a general
          interest in health, including diet, exercise, and mental well-being,
          which may lead them to discover this service. Alternatively, using the
          service itself might spark a broader interest in health and wellness.

        <h2>Usage issues</h2>
        <p>
          The biggest issues included a weekly overview that didn't serve a
          purpose, too much text that made it difficult to get an overview of
          the insights and quickly absorb the information. Too discret
          CTA-buttons and content at the wrong place.
        </p>

          The biggest improvements include a circular overview that corresponds
          with best practice that is placed on the homepage, as well as
          prediction of the next menstruation. More detailed insights hidden and
          can be reveiled by discret CTA-buttons, and usage of bold text and
          icons to make the information more easy-to-read. A button for viewing
          the insights of the next day, for those that don't have time or simply
          prefers to prepare the night before. A new section for purchasing and
          CTA-buttons leading there.
