          <h1>Travel planner</h1>

            A re-design of Stockholms official public transport app,
            specifically the user flow of planning a trip.

          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>
            To design an easy and intuitive travel planner for public transport
            in Stockholm
          </p>
          <h3>Context</h3>
          <p>
            To build on what I learned from my first UX-project I wanted to:<br /><br />

            - Test a shorter process to get richer insights from each
            observation​<br />​<br />

            - Take more detailed notes of every step of my process and the
            thoughts behind them​<br />​<br />

            - Gather data from more users by using reviews on Google Play​

        <h2>So, let's learn from the good and the bad</h2>
        <p>
          I started with benchmarking 3 travel planner apps and collecting the
          100 latest reviews of each app. One of them is the offical app for the
          public transport in Stockholm: SL. The second app is City Mapper which
          is a popular travel planner that can be used all over the world. And
          the third one is Google Maps, which is not specifically a travel
          planner but has that function as well and is a widely used app.
        </p>
        <img

          style="width: 100%"
        />
        <p>Why these?</p>
        <div class="highlightGroup">
          <p class="highlight">
            + 1 million downloads<br /><br />
            To ensure that I gather helpful data I have picked apps that are
            being used by a large amount of people
          </p>
          <p class="highlight">
            High and low ratings<br /><br />
            I want to learn which pitfalls to avoid as well as which best
            practices there are
          </p>
          <p class="highlight">
            Can be used in Stockholm<br /><br />
            Since the usability testings will take place in Stockholm, they need
            to function in this area
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>The most important findings from benchmarking:</p>
        <ul>
          Conventions
        </ul>
        <li>Presented with a search bar and a map on the homepage</li>

        <li>The departure location is preset to "My position" using the GPS</li>

        <li>There is a switch symbol between departure and destination</li>

        <li>The trip can be seen on a map</li>

        <li>
          The metro station symbol is placed on the beginning of each ride with
          the metro
        </li>

        <ul>
          Best practice
        </ul>
        <li>
          Clear overview of duration, number of changes and types of
          transportation
        </li>

        <li>Easy to reach search bar with right thumb</li>

        <li>Easy access of favourite stations</li>

        <li>Coloured line as a representations of the metro line</li>

        <li>Number of stops available</li>

        <ul>
          Pitfalls
        </ul>
        <li>Clock picker takes time to scroll</li>

        <li>The overview mistakes as part of detailed view of trip</li>

        <li>Cluttered homepage</li>

        <li>Live time confused with duration between stops</li>

        <li>Time settings blends into the map</li>

          <b>And what do the users think?</b> Well, most reviews were bad ones.
          But that is to be expected. After all, most times when people take the
          time to leave a review it is because they are unhappy about something.
          And usually those are the reviews the helps improve the product the
          most!

          style="width: 70%"
        />
        <p>
          The 100 latest reviews of each app was collected and then divided into
          2 groups. Constructive/relevant and unconstructive/irrelevant. A
          review just saying "Great!" or "Horrible!" for example is not that
          helpful. The constructive and relevant reviews was then transformed
          into notes, and grouped after theme.

          >Read more about the structuring of data</a
        >
        <p>This is how the biggest themes in the research can be summed up:</p>
        <div class="highlightGroup">
          <p class="highlight">
            <b>Incorrect results and directions</b><br /><br />
            Many had difficulties finding even the most common stops, the
            directions were wrong or didn't work at all, the wrong time were
            shown, local buses or commuter train couldn't be seen in the app,
            and error-message "can't understand the result" were shown.
          </p>
          <p class="highlight">
            <b>Non-forthcoming</b><br /><br />
            No warning about traffic disruptions causes a lot of discomfort, and
            planning a trip ahead is difficult when the time indications are
            live time.
          </p>
          <p class="highlight">
            <b>Disservice</b><br /><br />
            To start directions from "My position" instead of the the station is
            more troublesome than helpful. More often than not it doesn't match
            with the time it takes the user to get to the station.
          </p>
          <p class="highlight">
            <b> Visualization of transport</b><br /><br />
            Using the metro lines colors and symbols makes reading the
            directions easier.
          </p>
          <p class="highlight">
            <b>Shortcuts</b><br /><br />
            To make searching faster favourite stops are popular, and favourite
            route is also recuested as well as most recent searches.
          </p>
          <p class="highlight">
            <b>Interactive</b><br /><br />
            Appreciated when the app vibrates when you are approaching your stop
            and notifies if the train is not on time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Let's put some structure to it</h2>
        <p>
          The insights from all of the research were organized through a
          customer journey map that places them in order and makes sure none of
          them is forgotten while designing the screens
        </p>

          >See customer journey map</a
        >
        <h2>Ready, set - design!</h2>
        <p>
          Before the sketching could start, the screens were planned out through
          a flow diagram. It describes every component and functions of the
          screens and describes one typical user flow. During this, everything
          in the customer journey map and the affinity diagram have been taken
          into consideration.
        </p>

          >See flow diagram</a
        >
        <p>
          <b> Low fidelity sketches.</b> To be able to iterate the design fast,
          I chose to do a first draft with low fidelity sketches that
          illustrates the flow diagram.
        </p>

          >See lo-fi sketches</a
        >
        <p>
          <b> Prototype. </b>Building on the first draft of the sketches, a
          medium fidelity prototype was made. The flow includes some extra
          sketches to fully illustrate the features described in the flow
          diagram.

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>
          Would the project have more resources I would have conducted several
          usability tests moving forward to test the design and make iterations
          on the way. Before the test I would interview the user. The purpose of
          the design of the test script is to get to know if it is a frequent
          user of these kinds of apps, in which context they use the app and for
          what purpose they usually use the apps. Also, which features they want
          in this kind of app, pitfalls to avoid when designing and what the
          mental model is when planning a trip. I wanted to test the "My
          position" function and therefore gave them an exact adress to search
          from. I also wanted to test more functions and chose the date-picker.
