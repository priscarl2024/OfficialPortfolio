        <h2>Target group and background</h2>
        <p>
          The target group was one of your own choosing. All choices ahead were
          made with the target group in mind. A definition of the target group
          was made along with user need statements that defines their needs and
          goals. For this we created a persona called Felicia.
        </p>
        <img
          src="Portfolio-resurser/Flora Target group.jpg"
          style="width: 100%"
        />
        <img
          src="Portfolio-resurser/Flora User need statements.jpg"
          style="width: 100%"
        />
        <p>
          With the user need statements in mind, we generated several ideas to
          solve the target groups problem. We then went over the ideas, and
          choose one that we refined a bit more and decided to go with the
          subscription of flowers. We created a core description —a vision, if
          you will— for this idea, to really convey the feeling we wish to
          evoke.
        </p>
        <img
          src="Portfolio-resurser/Flora Idea generation.jpg"

        <img
          src="Portfolio-resurser/Flora Core description.jpg"
          style="width: 100%"
        />
        <p>
          We had noticed that most flower shops had an elegant sophisticated
          estethic to them, while the obvious connection between a colorful
          bouquet and youthful playfulness was overlooked. We wanted to use that
          to stand out from the crowd and use the trends of organic graphic
          forms to appeal to our target group.
        </p>
        <h2>Visual identity</h2>
        <p>
          To unite our vision of the visual identity and make it concrete we
          started with creating a vision board with the core description as our
          guide.
        </p>
        <img src="Portfolio-resurser/Flora Mind map.jpg" style="width: 100%" />
        <img

          style="width: 100%"
        />
        <p>
          We wanted the logo to balance the modern and the retro touch perfectly
          and started with testing several fonts and playing around with
          distortion of the font to add an abstract feel to it. At this point
          the name for the company was not chosen, so we used the working-name
          of Anna. We iterated different designs of a flower, with one being too
          retro and the other one being too scandinavian modest. We then
          designed the "half-flower" that had the balance we were looking for.
          The idea was a colorful logo to bring out the playfulness so we tested
          different color combinations from the vision board.
        </p>
        <img
          src="Portfolio-resurser/Flora Logo Process.jpg"

        <p>
          We struggled for some time with the idea of how many colors to include
          in the brand. Many enough to convey the playful feeling of a colorful
          bouquet, but few enough to create a strong recognizable brand. We
          decided on three brand colors and two neutrals. The brand colors—pink,
          orange, and green—were chosen to emphasize playfulness, joy,
          innocence, and energy, while also reflecting a connection to nature.
          The neutral tones are earthy, aligning well with the industry the
          company operates in.
        </p>
        <img src="Portfolio-resurser/Flora Colors.jpg" style="width: 100%" />

        <p>
          To make sure we followed the guidelines of WCAG regarding
          accessability we did a contrast-check of all the color combinations.
          This was used as a basis for decision-making of which colors and
          combinations to use on the most critical parts where perception is
          paramount.

        <h2>Design and solutions</h2>
        <p>
          We started by sketching a rough architecture of the app and then
          defined the user's subgoals for each screen, as well as the company's
          objectives for the same. With this in mind, along with research on
          best practices, we created several low-fidelity design sketches using
          the Crazy 8 method. For example, the landing page:
        </p>
        <ul>
          User goals
        </ul>
        <li>Understand the service</li>
        <li>Start a subscription</li>
        <li>Browse the offerings</li>
        <ul>
          Business goals
        </ul>
        <li>Create interest in the service</li>
        <li>Encourage the user to subscribe</li>
        <ul>
          Best practice
        </ul>
        <li>
          Remove the main navigation to guide the user where you want them to
          go.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a “long sales letter” approach, i.e., a long homepage with
          multiple sections featuring different types of information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incorporate plenty of white space to create a clean and spacious
          design.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure the page is scannable by using headings, bold or italicized
          text, numbered or bulleted lists, and concise paragraphs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Differentiate sections with separators or varying background colors to
          create a visual hierarchy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Include a Call to Action (CTA) and repeat it throughout the page for
          emphasis.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a Hero product image, showcasing your signature product with the
          highest value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Begin with an introduction of the page and a brief presentation of who
          you (the company) are.
        </li>
        <li>
          Highlight the main offering and make it easy for the user to start
          shopping.
        </li>

        <img
          src="Portfolio-resurser/Flora Lo-fi wireframes.jpg"
          style="width: 100%"
        />
        <p>
          In our med-fi wireframes we tested the visual language in the layout
          by combining ideas from the low-fidelity sketches. We conducted "user
          tests" with our sync group and made further adjustments based on the
          feedback we received. Finally, we used these iterations to test the
          colors in the user interface.<br />
          The findings included adding a back-button and a add and subtract
          button in the basket, as well as to remove the "keep shopping"-button
          since we now have the back-button. It also came to light that the
          add-button and the price could switch place to make it easier for the
          user to click the button.
        </p>

        <p>
          We made components and a librabry of them based on design patterns and
          other best practices.
