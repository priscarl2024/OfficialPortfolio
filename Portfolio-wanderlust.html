        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Competitive benchmark.</b> Since backpackers usually have to be
          considerate of how much they spend, I chose to benchmark three budget
          airlines and one aggregator (Norwegian, RyanAir, Pegasus Airlines and
          Momondo). The objective of this research was to benefit from existing
          best practices and to identify which pitfalls to avoid.

        <p>
          It was quite suprising how different the websites were. I found some
          similarities that gave me an idea about which conventions there are
          that must be followed, and also a lot of inspiration. There was also
          many not so great features that I instantly felt like I needed to
          avoid. However, there are some aspects that I can understand that they
          included from a pure business viewpoint, such as the "Don't miss out"
          model-box when you don't want to make a seat selection. The biggest
          take away was to make the interface clean and simple to understand,
          and to avoid annoying ads or forced memberships. As stated above, I
          understand that those aspects are probably placed there out of
          business aspects.

        <p>
          <b>Survey.</b>To learn more about the goals of the targeted group and
          which features they use most frequently, the objective of the survey
          was to find out the following:
        </p>
        <p class="list">
          - Which tasks are usually done on the computer vs which are done on
          the mobile. This tells me what to prioritize on the hompage.<br /><br />
          - Which context they usually are in when they visit an airline
          website, to know what to take into consideration.<br /><br />
          - Pitfalls to avoid<br /><br />
          - Which information is most important when looking for a flight, to
          make this information stand out on the page.<br /><br />
          - What is usually purchased when booking a flight, to know how to
          organize the workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          The survey showed that users use a computer to check prices, dates or
          travelling options. Also to check-in, book flights and to secure a
          safe payment. The context of use was usually at home. Pitfalls to
          avoid is to not show the full price upfront, an aestethically
          unpleasing website and rules and policies presented in an
          non-understandable way. Most important information was price and then
          dates. If anything extra was purchased it was usually a check-in bag.
          The participants were recruited amongst my friends, specifically
          friends that I knew had traveled alot. The survey had 7 participants.

        <p>
          <b>Usability test.</b>The test was conducted in person. The objective
          was to learn about the context of use of the target group as well as
          their goals and behaviour. The questions and tasks centered around
          longer one-way flights for one or two travellers to create a
          appropritate context.
        </p>
        <p class="list">
          Most important findings:<br /><br />
          - The page should not be overwhelmed by ads or too much information,
          and the important information should stand out in the form of bigger
          letters or by being more colorful.The user wanted to be sure to not
          miss any important information due to former mistakes and the process
          was time-consuming since it was difficult to prioritize the
          information. Price is the most influencial factor when choosing a
          flight, but it is also important that the date and time is clearly
          displayed to not risk missing the flight. Regarding this the itinerary
          was a helpful element of the process. <br /><br />
          - The user normally only adds a cabin bag and a check-in bag, and
          wouldn't normally make the ticket refundable. The differences between
          the fare types were too big.​<br /><br />
          - It is helpful when the calendar on the homepage shows which dates
          are available and cheaper. The mental model for lower prices is the
          color green.

          <b>Notes and affinity diagram.</b> To structure the research data each
          finding was noted on a post-it and tagged as a pain point or a
          positive.The color of the post-it indicates the source of the finding.
          It was first laid out as an overview, then a first grouping was made.
          Afterwards, adjustments were made to form the final groupings and they
          were given category names. This was conducted by myself.

          The categories outlined which parts of the process that was important
          to focus on when designing: Search/select dates, fare types, search
          again bar, price, flight time, search time, itinerary, luggage,
          membership, categories, menu and seat option. The last categories
          could be applied throughout the whole booking process: behaviour,
          aestethics, flow, communication, and technical.<br /><br />

          You've got some good notes within your affinity diagram. The tags in

          <b>Customer journey map.</b> To structure the analysis of the data
          further, a customer journey map was made that showcases the average
          users experience. Since it visualizes the data in chronological order
          it makes it more clear where the users flow easily and where the road
          blocks are.

        <p>
          The customer journey map shows that the road blocks are usually at the
          point where the user has made a search and are looking thorugh the
          flight options and also when making a seat selection. Also the baggage
          and meal selection, membership log-in and homepage was partly a road
          block. In those areas more innovative ideas needed to be appllied. In
          the remaining areas, passenger information and payment, mostly
          conventions was followed.
        </p>
        <h2>Design and validate</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Flow diagram.</b> A primary use case was defined that included the
          most crucial areas that was outlined in the affinity diagram and the
          customer journey map. It starts from the homepage up until the booking
          is confirmed, and includes seat selection.

        <p>
          The objective was to design a flow diagram that demonstrates how the
          issues of this use case would be solved. The red dots represents each
          action that is taken and the rest of the colors each represent a page.
          ​ A flow diagram makes it apparent if the user will move through the
          site easily or not, and it made me aware of minimizing the amount of
          actions the user has to take.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Interaction design.</b> The screens from the flow diagram was
          sketched out by hand as a first draft. Insights from the affinity
          diagram and the customer journey map was also taken into consideration
          since not all the details could be addressed in the flow diagram.

          It is a fast way of testing the layout and visual hiearchy that was
          imagined during the previous step. Amongst other things I tested how
          to make it clear what the flight time and the stopover time is,
          without them being confused with each other.

          Mainly choice of colors was made at this stage, since most hade been
          designed beforehand. The backdrop of the the homepage is a picture to
          inspire the user of possible places to travel to and to elevate their
          wanderlust further. The prototype has been updated after being tested.
          The first version of the prototype is shown in the usability test.

          During the test I found out that the illustration of price variation
          between dates was not comprehendeble, which was a valuable insight.
          After the test I went back to the iterative stage and redesigned some
          parts of the prototype.

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>
          To gain richer insights I would have conducted more research,
          especially more usability tests but also a larger number of survey
          participants. I would also make several design iterations followed by
          usability tests to be more confident of the designs success rate.
          Also, I think it could be beneficial to split up the booking process
          and make usability tests that focus on fewer tasks. That way the
          research goals are more precise and the observations are richer.
